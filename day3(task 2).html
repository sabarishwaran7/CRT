    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 (later acquired by Oracle Corporation). It's widely used for building platform-independent applications, meaning that code written in Java can run on any system that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Here a breakdown of the most important aspects of Java:</p><br>

<p> Key Features of Java
Platform Independent: "Write once, run anywhere"  Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on the JVM, regardless of the underlying OS.

Object-Oriented: Everything in Java is treated as an object (almost everything), which makes the language modular, flexible, and easier to maintain.

Strongly Typed: Java enforces strict type checking at compile time.

Garbage Collection: Java has automatic memory management, freeing up unused objects to prevent memory leaks.

Multithreaded: Java provides built-in support for multithreading (concurrent programming).

Secure: Java has runtime checking, a security manager, and supports access restrictions, making it suitable for network-based applications.
